// src/packages/flow-funding/engine/allocate.ts — 1644 M3 conserved allocator.
//
// Emergent, trust-weighted allocation (design §6.4): a holon's surplus is split
// across its below-floor claimants by NEED × TRUST-WEIGHT pull — need is gravity,
// trust is terrain, NO central router. Two caps bound the blast radius (HC-05):
//   - per-claimant cap: no single (possibly sybil-farmed) claimant captures the
//     surplus; farmed edges carry low trust-weight, so they pull weakly (DE-23).
//   - per-epoch cap: applied UPSTREAM by the caller bounding `surplus` so a deep
//     transitive cascade cannot drain a holon faster than its rate (DE-24).
// CONSERVATION (HC-01 / AX-H1): Σ(out) == surplus exactly. When the eligible
// claimants + caps cannot absorb the surplus, the allocator REFUSES LOUD with the
// residual — never a silent clamp or silent retention. Pure; no clock, no I/O.
